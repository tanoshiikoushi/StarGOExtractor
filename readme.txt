StarGOExtractor v1.0
====================
Made by: Koushi (https://twitter.com/tanoshii_koushi)

This tool extracts the U*GO archives produced by StarGODecompressor.
(U*GO means both UCGO and UDGO!)
Extracted files are sent to: "dir/where/archive/is/NAME/name" where:
'NAME' is the name of the input U*GO archive.
'name' is the name of the entry in the archive.

Usage:
StarGOExtractor <[-f file_path] [-d directory_path]>

Log File:
log.txt contains all the logged information.
To verify that there are no errors, search the log for "Error" -- no occurences means everything properly extracted.
